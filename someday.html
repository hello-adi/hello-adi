      <h1>Why?</h1>
      <p>
        "In an age where we interact primarily with branded and marketed web
        content,
        <a href="https://www.cameronsworld.net/" target="_blank"
          >Cameron’s World</a
        >
        is a tribute to the lost days of unrefined self-expression on the
        Internet. This project recalls the visual aesthetics from an era when it
        was expected that personal spaces would always be under construction."
        When building my personal website, it seemed fair to include the song
        that evoked the memory of a lost time. Performed by The Strokes, Someday
        is a song about feeling nostalgic for a time. I like the music video
        where a group of friends are sitting together and enjoying each other's
        company. So, as you explore the website, allow yourself to be seranaded
        by the song that inspired it all.

        This website is an amalgamation of graphics and styles from classic
        websites. The

          >Space Jam</a
        >
        website is a piece of digital history and served as the primary
        inspiration. Another inspiration was the
        <a href="https://yesterweb.org/no-to-web3/" target="_blank"
          >Yesterweb,</a
        >
        for it's nice and clean delivery of information. I also got many cool
        stamps, backgrounds, and design inspiration from
        <a href="https://lu.tiny-universes.net/index2.html">Lulu's website.</a>
        Such a cool and creative place.
        <a href="https://solaria.neocities.org/">Solaria's Webspace</a> was
        instrumental for CSS tips, design inspiration and cool assets. Finally,
        this would not have been possible without the help of
        <a href="https://gifcities.org/" target="_blank">GifCities</a> a search
        engine for GeoCities animated GIFs.
