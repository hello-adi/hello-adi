      <h1>Why?</h1>
      <p>
        "In an age where we interact primarily with branded and marketed web
        content,
        <a href="https://www.cameronsworld.net/" target="_blank"
          >Cameron’s World</a
        >
        is a tribute to the lost days of unrefined self-expression on the
        Internet. This project recalls the visual aesthetics from an era when it
        was expected that personal spaces would always be under construction."
        Adding on to those ideas, when building my personal website, it seemed
        fair to include the song that evoked the memory of a lost time.
        Performed by The Strokes, Someday is a song that speaks of nostalgia for
        a time. Even the video itself is a group of friends sitting together and
        enjoying. So as you explore the website, allow yourself to be seranaded
        by the song that inspired it all.

        This website is an amalgamation of graphics and styles from classic
        websites. The

          >Space Jam</a
        >
        website is a piece of digital history and served as the primary
        inspiration. Another inspiration was the
        <a href="https://yesterweb.org/no-to-web3/" target="_blank"
          >Yesterweb</a
        >
        website for it's nice and clean delivery of information. Finally, this
        would not have been possible without the help of
        <a href="https://gifcities.org/" target="_blank">GifCities</a> a search
        engine for GeoCities animated GIFs.
