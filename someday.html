      <h1>Why?</h1>
      <p>
        In an age where we interact primarily with branded and marketed web
        content, Cameron’s World is a tribute to the lost days of unrefined
        self-expression on the Internet. This project recalls the visual
        aesthetics from an era when it was expected that personal spaces would
        always be under construction. Adding on to those ideas, when building my
        personal website, it seemed fair to include the song that evoked the
        memory of a lost time. Performed by The Strokes, Someday is a song that
        speaks of nostalgia for a time. Even the video itself is a group of
        friends sitting together and enjoying. So as you explore the website,
        allow yourself to be seranaded by the song that inspired it all.
