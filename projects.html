      Keep the web free, say no to Web3 Web3 has been called many things: an
      idea, a movement, a new iteration of the internet. It’s the ‘future’ of
      the internet, proposed by cryptocurrency enthusiasts, based on public
      blockchain. This is a no-hype, down-to-earth breakdown of everything we
      have learned about Web3. What is Web3? What is a blockchain? What is a
      NFT? This page was edited and expanded on 12/12/21. It's being driven by
      predatory marketing tactics The purpose of marketing is to create demand
      in a market, to make people desire commodities and increase purchases of
      said commodities. A marketer is tasked to sell the product and not
      necessarily to educate potential buyers on the details of how the product
      operates. In cryptocurrency markets, every coinholder has a financial
      incentive to be their own marketer in order to increase the value of their
      own assets and can resort to any means necessary. Because of this, much of
      the Web3 hype being drummed up on Twitter - specifically focused on
      beginners, those new to Web3 and crypto - is predatory and follows along
      the lines of a ponzi scheme. Marie Springer, the author of The Politics of
      Ponzi Schemes, responded to the crypto hype in an interview, "I can't tell
      you how many Ponzi schemes have done exactly what you're describing, using
      exactly the mechanisms you're referring to. The only difference is usually
      these schemes are done with fiat currency." It's impossible to fully
      understand without complex technological and financial knowledge In
      economics, this type of thing is called information asymmetry. This is
      when one party has more or better information than the other in a market
      transaction. Those who stand to 'lose' don't have the time, energy,
      resources or knowledge to defend themselves. Without a complete
      understanding of what one is putting their money toward, it's impossible
      to make a correct judgement about whether or not that is the correct thing
      to do. If website participation is somehow tokenized, it will be used and
      abused- and just like blackhat SEO, the losers will be those that don't
      know what they are doing. The blockchain encourages information asymmetry
      by being dense, complicated and full of fly-by-night scammers, but it
      discourages it by making all of this difficult-to-understand information
      public. It is actively harming the environment One of the most glaring
      criticisms of anything crypto-related is its negative impact on our
      already declining ecosystem. The blockchain requires a significant amount
      of computing power, and thus consumes a lot of energy. In fact, some
      miners are purchasing entire power plants to dedicate to crypto mining.
      Crypto mining currently consumes more energy than many small countries,
      according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. What
      many fail to mention is the potential of climate-induced disruptions to
      the internet. With increasing frequency, intensity and duration of natural
      disasters linked to climate change, this seems like a real possibility
      that no one is talking about. It caters to early adopters and whales
